	SonnahInSpaceLow = The ions that make up Sonnahs radiation belt co-rotate with the planet, meaning that they ahceive huge velocities further out.
	ApturInSpaceHigh = Weak decametric radio emissions are detected from Aptur, as electrons from Sonnahs radiation belts are accelerated by Apturs small magnetic field.
	ApturInSpaceLow = The instrument detects a small bow shock on the retrograde side of Aptur, as plasma that is co-rotating with Sonnahs magnetic field is deflected by Apturs magnetic force.
	SerranInSpaceHigh = Very small emmissions are detected from Serrans poles, but the are almost drowned out by Sonnahs emmissions.
