		ErnusSrfLandedMeltedFace = The sample here melts the container you put it into; maybe Tupperware wasn't the best choice.
		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You decide white hot molten rock is probably not safe to handle, and quickly decide going home empty handed will be easier.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = As the ground shifts uncomfortably under you, you decide it's time to get back on the ship.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The ground here is a gooey mess, making the sample stick to everything.

		ArinSrfLandedWastes = You find the sand here is surprisingly similar to that back home on Kerbin. You consider stopping to make sandcastles, but KSC tells you to hurry up.
		ArinSrfLandedLowlands = The sand in the lowlands seems much more compacted than the wastes.
		ArinSrfLandedPolarCrater = You find remains of the meteorite that impacted Arin and determine it must have come from deep space.
		ArinSrfLandedMainlandCraters = You take a sample from the impact site, determined that this time you wonâ€™t lose it on the way back to the ship.
		ArinSrfLandedNorthernCrater = It seems the ground here has been covered over. The impact that caused the crater must have occurred a millennia ago.
		ArinSrfLandedTwinCraters = Rock samples show that this impact was cause by a single asteroid that must have split in two before impact.
		ArinSrfLandedCentralCrater = The sample here definitely tastes different to the rest of the planet.
		
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The surface appears to covered in a fine layers of dust and rocks.
		AstidSrfLandedPeak = You desperately try to brag samples before you start tumbling down the slope.

		DersoSrfLandedAlphaImpactSite = The surface here is covered in a dense glass-like substance created by this colossal impact, making a sample hard to get.
		DersoSrfLandedImpactedFlatlands = You try to take a sample of the fine dust covering this area, but it just floats away before you can get it into the container.
		DersoSrfLandedCrateredLowlands = The samples here show an abundance of minerals and metals, probably brought here from the asteroids that smashed into the surface.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The sample of the ridges on the surface shows that this planet was once covered in these steep hills before it was demolished by the alpha impact.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = I'm sure the exposed stone in this area will provide valuable insight about the history and composition of Derso.

		ApturSrfLandedLowlands = The dust seems magnetic, and won't come off the sampling instrument. You just place the sampling instrument into the sample bay, and hope that the scientists can figure out how to remove the dust later on.
		ApturSrfLandedMidlands = The dust keeps going into suborbital trajectories, rather than being scooped up.
		ApturSrfLandedHighlands = The scientists are yammering on about "Pyroxenes" and "Pervoskites", but all you can think of is what snack you'll be eating back in the ship. 
		
		SerranSrfLandedDesertedShores = Samples from the shores show that the erosion of the surface was due to massive sink-holes developing over millennia.
		SerranSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Compositions vary greatly in the craters, showing impacts ranging in materials.
		SerranSrfLandedMainland = The surface here is so blue you can help but have a quick taste. Mission control asks what flavour it is.
		SerranSrfLandedTwinCraters = The bed of the craters look roughly the same, so naturally you conclude the same asteroid must have bounced when it landed!
		SerranSrfLandedPolarImpact = Why did an asteroid impact all the way down here? It's so cold!
		SerranSrfLandedBleachedLand = The surface sample appears hard and clumpy. There appears to be large levels of metals in the ground here.

		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The ice is very hard and strong, and without letting Werner see, you simply place an empty bag in the sample box.
		NolasSrfLandedIcyHighlands = The sample dissolves all of your bags, so you just place it in the sample bay, confident it will be fine.

		LeouchSrfLandedExposedDepths = The sample is very hot, and mildly radioactive.
		
		TitanusSrfLandedPeaks = Snow, and some small pebbles. This would really hurt if you threw it at someone.
		TitanusSrfLandedMainlands = You throw the sample of snow at your crewmate. Due to a combination of high atmospheric drag and high gravity, it falls just a foot away from you.
		TitanusSrfLandedShores = Sandy Snow! Eww!

		TitanusSrfLandedCrystallizedWastes = We weren't allow to take a sample here.
		
		EteSrfLandedSurface = A large slab of surface, several meters in length, breaks off a slope. Despite mission controls orders, you try to place it in the sample container. It's fine if its hanging out of the bay, right?
		EteSrfLandedStretchedSurface = You take a sample off the highest point of the tallest ridge, and hope it will be preserved in a museum somewhere on Kerbin. 
		
		OreeSrfLandedEquatorialLands = The surface is composed of a brown gunk, with white particles of ice mixed in.
		OreeSrfLandedSouthernProtrusion = This tastes nothing like chocolate!
		OreeSrfLandedNorthernProtrusion = The goo eats the sample before you can get it into the sample bay! 
		
		TidusSrfLandedTidalShores = This sand is the perfect consistency for sandcastles.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticLands = You try to throw a snowball at your fellow kerbal, but the atmosphere stops it before it gets close.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticLands = you are to engrossed in Skiing to pick up a sample.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticHighlands = Snow. We went all this way, to find snow. 
		TidusSrfSplashedTidalOcean = You catch a small fish, and carefully place them into the sample container.
		TidusSrfSplashedTidalShores = You confirm that water acts the same on all worlds, as it still dramatically increases the surface humidity of any surface it touches.
		
		EtalSrfLandedLowlands = The surface is compacted ice and dust.
		EtalSrfLandedCrumpledGround = Your collection shovel cannot penetrate the surface material.
		EtalSrfLandedHighFlats = The regolith here is quite ordinary.
		EtalSrfLandedPolarFlats = Some of the crystals are glowing!
		EtalSrfLandedHighFlats = Some of the ice has collected into clumps, that are perfect for throwing at your fellow Kerbals!

		DersoSrfLandedImpactedFlatlands = Sensors show the craft is ever so slowly sinking into the fine dust of the area.

		TitanusFlyingLowCrystallizedWastes = The atmosphere is dusty here.
		TitanusFlyingLowCrystallizedWastes = Why do you ask so many questions.
		TitanusSrfLandedPeaks = The sample has some contamination from rock dust.
		TitanusSrfLandedMainlands = The atmosphere is very thick, which could impede walking here.
		TitanusSrfLandedShores = Typical, you come all this way, and the weather is uncooperative.
		TitanusSrfLandedFrozenWastes = The atmosphere has large amounts of Deuterium.
		TitanusSrfLandedCrystallizedWastes = The instrument is taken by some figures, dressed in black. They tell you to never return here. 
		
        VanorFlyingHigh = Analysis: lots of sulphur!
        VanorFlyingLow = The sulphur is mainly in its elemental form, suspended in a gaseous hydrogen atmosphere.
		
		TidusFlyingHighTidalShores = This atmosphere isn't of the breathable type.
		TidusFlyingHighArcticLands = The atmosphere has several layers of clouds, the upper layer is a thin ammonia haze.
		TidusFlyingHighArcticLands = This atmosphere is primarily nitrogen.
		TidusFlyingHighArcticHighlands = The cloud decks are lower in the atmosphere due to the lower temperature.
		TidusFlyingHighTidalOcean = The atmosphere here has high levels of water from the ocean below.
		TidusFlyingLowTidalShores = The atmosphere is dusty from the landslides of the unstable cliffs.
		TidusFlyingLowArcticLands = The middle cloud layer is sulphuric acid, and the lower cloud layer is water.
		TidusFlyingArcticLandsLands = The blizzards here last weeks, and are the primary reason why life doesn't exist here.
		TidusFlyingArcticLandsHighlands = The atmosphere is composed of just two large circulation cells, rather than Kerbin's 6.
		TidusFlyingLowTidalOcean = The humidity here is very high.
		TidusSrfLandedTidalShores = The atmosphere is so thick, that some types of plankton have become airborne, riding the thermals that the ocean creates.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticLands = The atmosphere has little in the way of oxygen, any organisms here must be nitrogen breathers.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticLands = The breezes here could carry off an unsuspecting kerbal.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticHighlands = The air is cold!
		TidusSrfSplashedTidalOcean = The sea spray contaminates the sensors, but confirms the presence of oceanic life.
		TidusSrfSplashedTidalShores = The atmosphere is so thick, that some types of plankton have become airborne, riding the thermals that the ocean creates.
