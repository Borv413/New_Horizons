This pack completely rearranges the stock system and introduced 19 more bodies to visit and explore, along with compatibility and many features to improve gameplay.

Firstly, ensure any older version of NH and Kopernicus have been removed.

You will need to DELETE (important) the following folders when updating:

GameData/Kopernicus

Gamedata/New_Horizons


PLEASE REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAMES BEFORE INSTALLATION/UPDATING. BUGS CAN OCCUR.

if you need to reset your ships landed on planets before/after updating, please use hyperedit as it makes resetting them simple and easy.
